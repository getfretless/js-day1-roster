This pair of scripts are used at the beginning of the 7-Day JavaScript Applications course at Eleven Fifty, now replaced by [this course](https://elevenfifty.com/course/javascript-programming-5-days/).

## Script 1: Writing 1-10 list items

This project includes markup and code in a single file and does the following:

* Prompt the user for a last name.
* Prompt the user for a number between 1 and 10, repeating the prompt upon receiving invalid input.
